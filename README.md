### Usage Notes ###

* The game only sends character names when it loads the battle (i.e. when you enter for the first time or refresh the page). So, for the logger to display the names if you opened it in battle, refreash the page. Same goes for RaidID.
* I don't know how the game updates boss hp when you're not doing anything so it only updates when you attack/ use skills / use summons.
* Click on Turns/Characters/Attacks in the battlelog to see additional details.

### TODO list ###

* Lots of testing
* Extra damage from summons are not logged yet
* Show if debuffs hit/miss (will get complicated)
* Saving data
